# ZILF Reference Guide

The goal is to list all commands in the ZILF developing environment with a short description 
of the command and some short examples to illustrate how the command is used.

This is not meant to be a designer manual but just a reference of the syntax of 
the commands and their usage.

81 entries left (in the MDL section).

The ODT-file is automatically generatet from Google Docs and have formatting issues.

The working document is currently at Google Docs here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Kz3tknK05hb0Cw41HmaHHkgR9eh0qNLAbE9TzZe--c/edit?usp=sharing
